/**
 * Java TreeSet class implements the Set interface that uses a tree for storage. It inherits the AbstractSet class and implements the NavigableSet interface.
 *
 * Some of the features of TreeSet are:
 *
 * TreeSet does not allow duplicate elements.
 * TreeSet class doesnâ€™t allow null elements.
 * Since elements are stored in a tree, the access and retrieval times are quite fast in a TreeSet.
 * The elements are stored in ascending order in a TreeSet.
 *
 * Difference between a HashSet and TreeSet#
 * The HashSet allows one null element, whereas a TreeSet does not allow a null element.
 * The elements are stored in random order in a HashSet, whereas it is stored in sorted order in TreeSet.
 * HashSet is faster than Treeset for the operations like add, remove, contains, size, etc.
