     * The complexity of adding an element in a LinkedList is O(1)
        If we need to search for the position where the Node needs to be inserted, then the complexity is O(n)
     * , but the element is usually inserted at the beginning or end, which makes it O(1)
     * The biggest benefit of LinkedList, in comparison to an array, is that in a LinkedList, in comparison to an array,
     * is that when new elements are added or removed, the other elements are not rearranged.
     * Removing an element is also an O(1)
     * operation if we are aware of the position of the element that needs to be removed. If we need to search and remove an element, it is an O(n)
     * Searching an element is an O(n)
     *  operation, as the entire LinkedList is iterated to search the element in the worst case.
